# üêâ Hydra

## What is Hydra?

Hydra is a popular open-source password cracking tool that can be used to perform brute-force attacks on login credentials of various network protocols, including FTP, HTTP, SSH, Telnet, and others. It uses different attack methods, including dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, and hybrid attacks, to guess passwords and gain unauthorized access to a system.

Hydra can be used to test the strength of passwords used in network systems and identify potential vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers. It is often used by security professionals, network administrators, and penetration testers as a tool to assess the security of their systems and identify weaknesses that need to be addressed.

According to its [official repository](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra), Hydra supports, i.e., has the ability to brute force the following protocols: ‚ÄúAsterisk, AFP, Cisco AAA, Cisco auth, Cisco enable, CVS, Firebird, FTP, HTTP-FORM-GET, HTTP-FORM-POST, HTTP-GET, HTTP-HEAD, HTTP-POST, HTTP-PROXY, HTTPS-FORM-GET, HTTPS-FORM-POST, HTTPS-GET, HTTPS-HEAD, HTTPS-POST, HTTP-Proxy, ICQ, IMAP, IRC, LDAP, MEMCACHED, MONGODB, MS-SQL, MYSQL, NCP, NNTP, Oracle Listener, Oracle SID, Oracle, PC-Anywhere, PCNFS, POP3, POSTGRES, Radmin, RDP, Rexec, Rlogin, Rsh, RTSP, SAP/R3, SIP, SMB, SMTP, SMTP Enum, SNMP v1+v2+v3, SOCKS5, SSH (v1 and v2), SSHKEY, Subversion, TeamSpeak (TS2), Telnet, VMware-Auth, VNC and XMPP.‚Äù

## Installing Hydra

If you prefer to use the Kali machine, Hydra also comes pre-installed, as is the case with all Kali distributions.

However, you can check its official repositories if you prefer to use another Linux distribution. For instance, you can install Hydra on an Ubuntu or Fedora system by executing `apt install hydra` or `dnf install hydra`. Furthermore, you can download it from its official [THC-Hydra repository](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra).

## Cheatsheet

The following table uses the $ip variable which can be set with the following command:

`export ip 10.10.10.2`

## Example of usage

### SSH

`hydra -l <username> -P <full path to pass> 10.10.44.136 -t 4 ssh`

| Option | Description                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `-l`   | specifies the (SSH) username for login |
| `-P`   | indicates a list of passwords          |
| `-t`   | sets the number of threads to spawn    |

For example, `hydra -l root -P passwords.txt 10.10.44.136 -t 4 ssh` will run with the following arguments:

* Hydra will use `root` as the username for `ssh`
* It will try the passwords in the `passwords.txt` file
* There will be four threads running in parallel as indicated by `-t 4`

### Post Web Form

We can use Hydra to brute force web forms too. You must know which type of request it is making; GET or POST methods are commonly used. You can use your browser‚Äôs network tab (in developer tools) to see the request types or view the source code.

`sudo hydra <username> <wordlist> 10.10.44.136 http-post-form "<path>:<login_credentials>:<invalid_response>"`

| Option                | Description                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-l`                  | the username for (web form) login                                                        |
| `-P`                  | the password list to use                                                                 |
| `http-post-form`      | the type of the form is POST                                                             |
| `<path>`              | the login page URL, for example, `login.php`                                             |
| `<login_credentials>` | the username and password used to log in, for example, `username=^USER^&password=^PASS^` |
| `<invalid_response>`  | part of the response when the login fails                                                |
| `-V`                  | verbose output for every attempt                                                         |

Below is a more concrete example Hydra command to brute force a POST login form:

`hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> 10.10.44.136 http-post-form "/:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=incorrect" -V`

* The login page is only `/`, i.e., the main IP address.
* The `username` is the form field where the username is entered
* The specified username(s) will replace `^USER^`
* The `password` is the form field where the password is entered
* The provided passwords will be replacing `^PASS^`
* Finally, `F=incorrect` is a string that appears in the server reply when the login fails
